# G.O.A.P.-Project
This small Unity project was made for McGill's Modern Computer Games course. Its goal is to create (from scratch) an implementation of Goal-Oriented Action-Planning (G.O.A.P.). Specifically, this project involves squirrels which will take plans to wander, collect food (either nuts or from within trash cans) and will also dynamically abandon their plans if the player gets too close to them. Download, build and run as with any Unity project. An example of the project is shown below:
